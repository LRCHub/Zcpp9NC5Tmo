```lrc
[00:20.77] I feel like I'm gorgeous
[00:25.62] Tryna find the beauty in pain
[00:30.12] And all I see is scars
[00:35.14] Remind me of my flaws
[00:45.64] 
[00:38.66] I'm okay
[00:42.57] I'm okay
[00:46.57] 
[00:59.59] Smoke come out my mouth like the Holy Ghost
[01:04.48] Livin' on the high, and I'm fully clothed
[01:08.72] I'm sittin' on the floor like garden in Eden
[01:11.92] If you could see what I've been seein', the apple is seedless
[01:42.42] 
[01:16.08] I go with God
[01:22.58] 
[01:27.88] I've been lookin' at the sky for hours
[01:32.60] I've been plannin' my escape for months
[01:36.40] I've been buildin' a castle in the sky
[01:38.56] Carry stones with the storms
[01:40.93] I've been a plannin' a battle I could fight
[01:43.66] Like a war when I'ma go
[01:55.16] 
[01:46.12] When I'm sitting on the throne, I'm nobody's no soul
[01:51.05] Scream thunder, cry gold
[01:53.45] I could feel it, I could feel it, heaven is a ceiling
[01:58.08] I got the spirit
[02:00.67] I got the spirit
[02:04.06] Spirit
[02:09.07] I got the spirit
